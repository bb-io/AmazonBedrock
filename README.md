## Introduction

<!-- begin docs -->

Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that offers a choice of high-performing foundation models from leading AI companies like AI21 Labs, Anthropic, Cohere, Stability AI, and Amazon with a single API, along with a broad set of capabilities you need to build generative AI applications, simplifying development while maintaining privacy and security.
